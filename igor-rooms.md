team turgle
#### The Drunken Albatross
theres a commotion coming from the tavern which can be heard from a ways away. A poster on the front of The Drunken Albatross says 
"the competition will begin here in front of the tavern tomorrow at noon".

There is barely room to walk around all the other adventurers who have come to participate in the challenge. 
People of all races and backgrounds fill the tavern.
The one serving boy, can barely keep up with demand. There's gambling at some of the tables. 
In the far corner there is a group of gnomes, who are playing darts. 
>the Forgehand apprentices Pavel, Vassily, and Katarina

At the far end of the bar is seated figure in a dark cloak, and everyone is giving it a wide berth. 

> Anyone who actually touches the figure will realize that it is a broomstick draped
in a black cloak. If the party has spent any time attempting
to interact with the broomstick, the entire tavern will erupt
into laughter as soon as the deception is uncovered, and the
gnomes playing darts in the corner will put another tally on
the wall, which is now up to 11. The gnomes will invite the party over if they fall for the
trick and are willing to chat. They played some role in the
creation of the dungeon and are happy to drop a few hints.`
`The dungeon is non-lethal, but full of traps and tricks to
eliminate contestants. They have met Igor and are familiar
with him, though not very knowledgeable. They will
confirm any information from the History check in the
About Igor section above, and add that Igor is also a
master illusionist.
The party can also find this information
by interacting with other groups Charisma (Persuasion) check DC 13. 
The room is abuzz with news that the legendary hero Testicles is coming

#### Room 1: 

The party will make their way to the nearest entrance,
which appears to be a slide down into the mountain. The
slide is spinning and rotating, and any look in will show
that there are multiple slides down with very little way to
determine which you head down. Each player who jumps in
should roll a 1d6. Those who roll 1 or 2 go to Room 2, 3
and 4 slide into Room 3, and 5 and 6 wind up in Room 4.
Part of the mechanism which creates the rotation is
visible and accessible at the top. A Strength (Athletics)
check DC 10 can keep the slide motionless for as long as
somebody is holding it so that the group can all go down
the same slide... except for the person holding the
mechanism still, who will have to jump in and roll.

#### Room 2

The room is a small, simple one consisting only of one door
on the opposite end of the room which the player(s) slid
into, and a circus-style strength test. The game is to pick up
the provided Warhammer and hit the lever which will
propel a lead shot up the runners to the bell at the top. The
player must stand on the visible pressure plate in front of
the game.
A Strength (Athletics) check DC 12 will be enough to
ring the bell and move on, but allow other ingenious
solutions. The bell must be hit by the lead shot, not by
another object. If they fail two tries, the pressure plate
opens up and they fall into a slide leading to the loser's
room.
Upon opening the door, there is a T intersection with an
alcove at the apex containing one Potion of Healing. Left
leads to Room 5, while right leads to Room 6.

#### Room 3

The room is full of what appear to be mirrors, and is clearly
a mirror maze. The group can navigate the maze with a
Wisdom (Perception) check DC 12. If a player fails they run
into a mirror, which actually is a teleporter leading to the
loser's room. Other players with them can attempt a
Strength (Athletics) check DC 10 to pull them out before
they are pulled into the teleporter.
At the end is an unlocked door leading to a T intersection
with an alcove at the apex containing one Potion of
Climbing. Left leads to Room 7, while right leads to Room 8

#### Room 4

This room opens up into a massive chasm in the mountain.
A look down reveals that the chasm tapers off into a slide to
the loser's room. The only bridge across is a narrow yet
heavy plank of wood balanced on a pivot in the center of the
chasm, essentially a massive seesaw. A Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check of 12 is enough to cross the bridge. A
character can hold the bridge in place for another to cross
with a Strength (Athletics) check DC 12 as well.
Upon opening the door, there is a T intersection with an
alcove at the apex containing one Potion of Animal
Friendship. Left leads to Room 9, while right leads to Room 10.

#### Room 5

The room is dark until the players cross the threshold of
the arch into the room. Upon entry, pounding techno music
begins, mannequins will make their way in patterns around
the room, and the floors will begin lighting up in a pattern
which shows the proper path through the mannequins and
the pit traps. A character proficient in Performance can
make a check DC 15 to dance across the floor with the
music, and if desired lead one other character through with
them. If they do not have perform, a character can perform
two checks, Intelligence (Investigate) DC 14 to find the
pattern and then Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 14 to follow it.
If they fail, they fall into one of the pits leading to the losers'
room.
Upon opening the door at the far end of the dance floor,
there is a T intersection with an alcove at the apex
containing one Potion of Growth. Left leads to Room 11,
while right leads to Room 12.

#### Room 6

The room is actually a large cave with a swamp that is
clearly bubbling with acid. It would be exceptionally painful
to wade through it. Fortunately, somewhere in the middle,
is a well-trained and clean Catoblepas. A Wisdom (Animal
Handling) check DC 15 is enough to coax the Catoblepas
over and get it to ferry you across the swamp. Alternatively
they can turn around and try another room.
Upon opening the door on the other side of the swamp,
there is a T intersection with an alcove at the apex
containing one Potion of Fire Resistance. Left leads to
Room 13, while right leads to Room 14.

#### Room 7

This is a large, well-built room that appears quite fancy.
The walls are painted and covered in golden designs that
would suit the interior of a noble household. It appears to
be completely empty.
The far wall is actually an illusion, and the group can
walk right through it. Any attempt to interact with the wall
will reveal its illusory nature. Behind the false wall is a
door. The door, however, leads to a dark passage that is
greased and turns into a slide, making them fall down into
the losers' room. The real door is hidden by another
illusion in the corner of the room. An Intelligence
(Investigation) check DC 15 will reveal the second illusion.
Any creature who has cast Detect Magic will have
advantage on this check.
Upon opening the real door, there is a T intersection with
an alcove at the apex containing one Potion of Psychic
Resistance. Left leads to Room 15, while right leads to
Room 16.

#### Room 8

The room is a small square made of rock. As soon as they
all enter, the door behind them slams shut and the room
begins filling with water from a pipe at the top. With the
water comes a set of 20 keys. Have them make a
Constitution check, they will have enough time to try keys
equal to the number they rolled on the check. Each time
they select a key, roll 1d20, rerolling any repeats. A roll of
20 will find the right key. Alternatively, a Wisdom
(Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 15
will be able to find the key that seems shaped appropriately
for the keyhole to the door out. If they fail to find the key in
time, they will pass out briefly until the room drains down
the pit which opens and leads to the losers' room where an
attendant will revive them.
Upon opening the door, there is a T intersection with an
alcove at the apex containing one Potion of Water
Breathing. Left leads to Room 17, while right leads to
Room 18.

#### Room 9

This room is a large, unadorned space shaped like a tear
drop. The entry is on the side of the tear drop and the exit
is straight across. At the apex of the tear drop is a slide
down, leading to the losers' room. Once everyone is inside
the door closes behind them. A statue pops up in the
middle of the floor that casts Fear on all who can see it.
Each character makes a Wisdom saving throw DC 15 to
resist the spell. Upon failure, they must run from the statue
to the furthest and safest space possible, which is down the
slide. The far door is unlocked.
Beyond the door there is a T intersection with an alcove
at the apex containing one Potion of Thunder Resistance.
Left leads to Room 19 and right leads to Room 20.

#### Room 10

Before entering the room, while still walking down the
corridor, they can see (and smell, and hear) quite clearly
that something living is up ahead. An Intelligence (Nature)
check DC 12 will reveal that it is a pack of Basilisks. They
are docile, but their gaze is still dangerous. Characters can
avert their eyes and attempt to navigate through the room,
which is full of pit traps. If they succeed a Wisdom
(Perception) DC 15 they navigate successfully to the
unlocked door on the far side. They can alternatively run
through and make a Constitution saving throw DC 11 to
not be turned to stone. If they are turned to stone, an
attendant will be along to take them to the losers' room for
healing.

Upon opening the door, there is a T intersection with an
alcove at the apex containing one Potion of Cold
Resistance. Left leads to Room 21, while right leads to
Room 22.

#### Room 11

Written upon the archway leading into the room is written
in multiple languages "Find the missing part to fix the
door." The room is a small one with only a heavy door with
a massive bolt across it. It is clear that the mechanism to
remove the bolt is on the wall, but it is incomplete. Show
the players the puzzle in Appendix 2. The solution is to
move the gear in the top right of the picture over to the
empty peg. If they give up, they can go backwards or jump
down the pit to the losers' room in the corner.
Upon solving the puzzle to open the door, there is an
alcove containing one Driftglobe. The passage leads
forward to Room 23.

#### Room 12

In this rectangular room there are four pedestals with
bowls on the top to put items into, each with a riddle
written on it. On the first is "I have a head but no arms, a
tail yet no legs." On the second is "Every morning a noggin
I shed, every evening I regain my head." On the third is "A
little round a little straight, the picture is clear but we love
to obfuscate." On the fourth is "Flip me by night, flip me by
day, will it help, who can say?" On the back wall by the
entrance is a table with three items on it; a coin, a pillow,
and a puzzle piece. There are not enough items to go into
the four pedestals. Ripping any in half does not help, nor
does providing your own items. The trick is that the far
door only looks locked when in fact it is not. They can walk
right through the room.
Upon opening the door, there is an alcove containing one
Immovable Rod. The passage leads forward to Room 24.

#### Room 13

This room is full of what looks to be poorly hidden pit traps
in a pattern as if they were the black squares in an 8x8
chess board throughout the room. The pits seem apparent
and covered with simple and poorly disguised canvas tarps
or even sticks and leaves, despite not fitting at all into the
environment of the cave. The trick is that these are
illusions and the real pit traps leading to a slide down to
the losers' room are all the areas of floor that look safe, or
the white squares. The players can attempt an Intelligence
(Investigation) check DC 16 to realize the trick.
Upon making it to the far door, there is an alcove
containing one Keoghtum's Ointment. The passage leads
forward to Room 24.

#### Room 14

This is a T shaped room with the classic puzzle of one door
that always lies and one door that always tells the truth.
The door which lies is the real exit, while the door that tells
the truth is a false exit leading to a slide down to the losers'
room.
Upon opening the door that lies, there is an alcove
containing one Lantern of Revealing. The passage leads
forward to Room 25.

#### Room 15

This is a T shaped room with two doors and the word
MAGIC! carved into the apex of the T. Both doors are
unlocked, but inside is a 9th level Darkness spell obscuring
the view forward, meaning they must walk into it without
knowing what is ahead of them. If the word MAGIC! is
targeted with any spell above a cantrip, it will light up and
an arrow will point left, to the real door. The fake door is a
slide down to the losers' room.
Upon solving the puzzle to open the door, there is an
alcove containing one Oil of Etherealness. The passage
leads forward to Room 25.

#### Room 16

In the room is a locked door out and two pedestals with
two bowls on them as well as two packs of marbles. The
instructions above the door say that you must put the
marbles into the bowls, and both bowls and all marbles
must be used used. Then, you will be plunged into total
magical darkness and will have to pull one marble from
one of the bowls. If they pull out a black marble, they are
teleported to the losers' room. If they pull out a while
marble the door unlocks.
Allow for innovative solutions. One simple solution is to
put only one (or very few) white marbles into one bowl and
the rest into the other; in this way, even blind they will
know which bowl holds the white marbles. The trick is
mostly the assumption that most players will make that the
bowls must be filled equally.
Upon solving the puzzle to open the door, there is an
alcove containing one Potion of Firebreath. The passage
leads forward to Room 26

#### Room 17

The corridor continues on and then drops off into a shallow
pool of water the width of the passageway, 5 feet. An
Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) check DC 15 will
reveal that there are magical sigils written on the wall just
a little ways above the water line. If one person goes in, the
water raises just below the sigils, which are not activated,
and they can continue on without incident for 50 feet until
they can climb out of the pool. If two people enter the pool
at the same time, the water displacement is enough to push
the water line above the sigils, which activate and teleport
all those in the pool to the losers' room.
Upon exiting the pool on the other side, there is an
alcove containing one Potion of Greater Healing. The
passage leads forward to Room 26.

#### Room 18

This is a T shaped room with two doors and the word
Overthinking written into the wall at the apex of the T.
Neither door is a trap and both lead forward to the next
room. After either door, the two passages meet back up and
there is an alcove containing one Oil of Slipperiness. The
passage leads forward to Room 27.

#### Room 19

The room is a very fancy one with the walls painted in
murals of hammers, particularly warriors wielding
hammers against their enemies. In the middle of the room
is a pedestal shaped like a large hammer with a small box
on top. The box is unremarkable and far less fancy than the
room it resides in. Inside is a key. The door out is locked
and the key fits right in. The door leads to a slide down to
the losers' room. The trick is to break the walls down. The
walls come down easily and lead to a path around the room
and to the next one. Along this path out there is an alcove
containing one Potion of Superior Healing. The passage
leads forward to Room 27.

#### Room 20

This is a 40 by 15 foot room with 8 levers on the wall, each
5 feet away from each other. They must pull them in order
to open up the locked door on the far side. The correct
answer is written in gnomish above the door: 18524673.
Every time they pull a wrong lever, that part of the floor
falls out. They can try again, but each failure makes it
harder to manoeuvre and reach the levers. Players must
pass a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check DC 10 + 2 times the
number of failures already made to reach each lever and
attempt to pull it.
Upon solving the puzzle to open the door, there is an
alcove containing one Potion of Flying. The passage leads
forward to Room 28.

#### Room 21

This is a large room with a door on the far side. It does not
appear to be locked. The room is scattered with gold and
small gems. Taking more than 15 gp worth of gems or gold,
however, activates the sigils on the wall that will teleport
those that pick up too much to the losers' room. The far
door is not locked and the players can pass right through.
Past the door there is an alcove containing one Potion of
Clairvoyance. The passage leads forward to Room 28.

#### Room 22

The room is 10 by 10 feet, but very tall. There is a trap door
at the very top. The only other thing in the room is a bucket
half full of water. The bucket is actually a Decanter of
Endless Water and can be used to fill up the room with
water and swim to the top. Past the door is a passage
which leads forward to Room 23.

#### Room 23

This is a long corridor continuing on from the last room.
There is a pit leading to the losers' room in the middle of
the floor which can be easily avoided. After the pit the
passage begins curving in a spiral going up at a steady
incline at the same time that it turns into a circular tunnel
rather than a carved out hallway. The path can be walked
without issue but it is headed uphill. If they have a passive
perception above 18, they will hear a rumbling which
suggests a boulder rolling down. They will have more time
to prepare an action and ask questions about the boulder
that they see coming around the corner. The boulder is
large, but a good jump should clear it with enough space on
the top. The boulder would be big enough to fil into the pit
at the start of the incline.
If they do not notice it coming, it will be on top of them
before they have a chance to plan. Offer the choice of a
Dexterity saving throw (DC 18) to jump it, or a Strength
saving throw to hold it. The boulder is fake and touching it,
either by attempting the Strength save or failing a Dexterity
saving throw will engage the spell on the boulder, a version
of Command Person which on a failed Wisdom saving
throw DC 17 will compel them to walk backwards and
jump into the pit to the losers' room.
The corridor levels out and eventually leads to room 29.
Along the way there is an alcove with one Bead of Force.

#### Room 24.

This is a large circular room full of doors with a pit in the
center. All of the doors are trained mimics that will not
attack but will attempt to grapple the players and push
them into the pit in the middle of the room. Each mimic
has Strength (Athletics) +8 to their grappling roles. The
actual door out is a trap door above the pit. Let the players
know of its existence on any request to know more about
the room that is not specifically asking to investigate each
door.
Beyond the door is a passageway with an alcove
containing one Bead of Force. The passageway leads to
Room 30.

#### Room 25

This room seems entirely ordinary viewed from outside
beyond the archway leading in. There is no door on the
other side, just another arch. If the players ask about what
is up, the ceiling is cone shaped leading far, far upwards. As
soon as a player enters the room, a Reverse Gravity spell
activates. Each player must make a Constitution saving
throw DC 18 or fall upwards and to a slide down to the
losers' room. After a few rounds, the spell ends and they
can walk straight across the room. Once nobody is in the
room, the spell reactivates and waits for the next character
to enter the room. Beyond is a passageway with an alcove
containing one Bead of Force. The passageway leads to
Room 30.

#### Room 26

This room, as well as the corridor leading in, is totally dark,
but not magically so. Characters with darkvision can see
well enough, but only in shades of grey. The room, however,
is painted in fluorescent colors. The door is colored in a
pattern of Red, Green, Yellow, Green, Red, Blue, Green,
Blue. In the middle of the room is a set of four buttons, one
each of Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue. The buttons must be
pressed in the order of the colors on the door. Each failure
leads to the floor retracting somewhat, and three failures
will leave nowhere to stand and eventually falling down into
the losers' room. Anyone who brought a source of light and
uses it will see the problem right away. Beyond the door
which unlocks after the right sequence of buttons is pushed
is a passageway with an alcove containing one Bead of
Force. The passageway leads to Room 31.

#### Room 27

In the middle of this large, circular room is a ladder leading
up to a trap door on the ceiling, which appears to be the
only way out. The floor, however, is unstable; it is a giant
disc balanced on a point in the middle, under the ladder.
There is a walkable ring around the wall. The trick is to get
two people to opposite ends of the room and to walk into
the middle together to keep the disc balanced. Alternatively,
a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check DC 18 will be enough for
one person to get to the middle. Through the trap door is a
passageway with an alcove containing one Bead of Force.
The passageway leads to Room 31.

#### Room 28

In this oval shaped room is an ornate fountain on the left
and a large box on the right. A note on the box says that
"The Mithril Key will open the door." The box is completely
full of over 500 identical keys. An Intelligence (Arcana)
check DC 18 will realize that mithril looks like steel but
will float in water while steel will not. Beyond the door
unlocked by the mithril key is a passageway with an alcove
containing one Bead of Force. The passageway leads to
Room 29.

#### Room 29

This large room seals itself closed as soon as anyone enters
it. A countdown from 120 seconds will begin immediately.
Above the only door out is the message "Only the fast and
fleet escape sleep" in multiple languages. If people read
multiple languages, they will see that each varies slightly,
such as "quick and free" or "swift and unhindered." The
gnomish, however, reads clearly "Those with Haste and
Freedom of Movement escape sleep." The gas, which will
cause sleep in any after minute, even those resistant or
immune to magical sleep, will begin filling the room. If they
fall asleep, the floor opens up and takes them to the losers'
room. In the middle of the room is a variety of potion
making ingredients; red drake root (R), blue phirna stalks
(B), and yellow poppysnap flowers (Y), as well as lots of
empty bottles and a mortar and pestle. An Intelligence
(Nature or Arcana) check DC 15 will realize that the two
spells noted can be made through combining these
ingredients, and passing a DC 20 will know the mixture.
R+B= P, cure poison. R+Y=G, potion of resist elemental
damage. B+Y=O, potion of enhance ability (roll 1d6 to
determine which ability). G+O= Haste, O+P= Freedom of
Movement. If they cast the two spells on themselves, either
through potions or spellcasting, they resist the sleep gas.
After two minutes, the potions will wear off but the door
will also open. The room remains sealed to new players
entering for another minute.
The passage beyond has an alcove which contains one
Candle of Invocation appropriate for your party, and the
passage leads to Room 32.

#### Room 30

This medium sized room is largely featureless except for
the locked door out and a massive key ring hanging from a
rope tied to the ceiling. There are easily 100 rings on this
massive ring, which is made of a strange, somewhat
flexible metal material. If the players attempt to try the
keys, have them roll a 1d100, rerolling repeated numbers.
None of the keys work, however. The solution is that the
keyring itself is the key and can be pushed into the lock. If
the players ask to look at the lock on the door, ask for an
Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 18 and let them know
that the key hole is clearly larger than any of the keys on the
ring. If they give up, they can jump down the pit in the
corner which leads to the losers' room.
Once they open the door, there is an alcove in the
passageway containing Nolzers Marvelous Pigments, and
the corridor leads forward to Room 32.

#### Room 31

This small room contains only a magically sealed door out,
a table with several chairs around it, a shelf full of bottles
which are clearly spirits, and Jalek who is sitting in one of
the chairs at the table. Jalek introduces himself as one of
Igor's close friends, and says that he knows the password
which will open the door. He will give it to you if you beat
him either in an arm-wrestling contest, or a drinking
contest.
If the players choose arm wrestling, they need to beat
Jalek in a best two out of three Strength (Athletics) contest.
Jalek has a +10 to his rolls.
If the players chose the drinking contest, they must last
four drinks with Jalek and pass four successive
Constitution Saving Throws DC 10, 12, 14, and finally 16.
Whichever challenge the players beat, Jalek will provide
the password, which should be something they would not
be able to guess on their own. Upon opening the door, there
is an alcove in the corridor containing one high-level Spell
Scroll. The corridor continues on to Room 32.

#### Room 32

This is by far the largest room in the dungeon so far, a
massive dome carved out of the rock of the mountain, a
radius of at least 80 feet. At the far end of the entrance
ways stands a massive, magnificent door. The players
should be impressed that this appears to be the final room.
Unlike the walls which are still rough stone, the floor is
flattened and polished to a glimmering sheen. Into the floor
are carved five massive murals of dragons. On the back
wall are five large vessels in five different colors; Blue, Red,
Yellow, Green, and White. The water inside each has been
dyed the same color as the vase. The challenge appears to
be to pick the correct color for the correct dragon and pour
it in. Failure will result in a teleportation spell activating
and taking those in the room to the losers' room. A success
will light up and a loud clank will be heard throughout the
room of one bolt in the door unlocking.
Your players can request to roll Intelligence (History or
Religion) check DC 20 to recognize that that the murals
depict legendary dragons and to know which colors
correspond to which dragons.

#### Room 33

At the end of the corridor leading to this room there is a
short drop down to the room. As soon as the players stick
their heads through the archway they can see that there is
an illusion on the opposite side which means that the
archway cannot be seen from inside the room. Let them
know that once they jump in, they cannot reach this place
again.
Written into the stone of the archway to the room are the
rules;
This game is called
Petals around the Rose
The score will always be 0 or an even number
When a character jumps in, five dice will appear and roll to
a stop on the ground. They must guess the correct score in
a best of five challenge in order to open the door.
Pick 5d6. The dice faces must use Pips, not numbers.
Ideally the dice will be of three different colors. Roll them
in front of the players to let them puzzle it out.
_The answer is that you only count the dice which roll 5
and 3: each 5 is worth four points, and each 3 is worth two.
This is because those faces have pips on the edge (petals)
around a central pip (the rose)._
If your players are having a lot of difficulty with this
puzzle, ask one or more to roll a Wisdom (Insight) check
DC 10 and remind them that so far everything in this
dungeon has been a trick or trap. The answer to this puzzle
is likely going to be found by thinking outside of the box,
that it will be simple and elegant and probably not a maze
of mathematical computations.
Once they solve the puzzle, the final door opens and
leads to a short corridor. Ahead they see what is clearly a
reception room with an old gnome seated by a medium
sized box.

#### The Prize

Igor Larionov introduces himself and congratulates them
on their accomplishment, confirming that they are the first
adventurers to complete the dungeon. When describing the
prize, describe the item as that item which whoever is
receiving The Splendiferous Bauble most desired earlier in
the adventure. Describe it as even beyond their
imagination. Also mention that, despite Igor offering them
The Splendiferous Bauble, they feel that just beating the
dungeon was not enough, they should give Igor their most
valuable item on their person, whatever that is. At this
point, if they or other players are sceptical, have them make
Intelligence saving throws against the charm of the item.
Even if they pass, they will recognize that The
Splendiferous Bauble is a powerful magic item and,
whatever they give away, they can probably receive another
or a better one by using the prize at a later time.
Igor should leave as soon as the prize is handed over,
bidding them good luck and making excuses for other
places to be. They can then take a slide down to the losers'
room where everyone will cheer them and toast their
accomplishment. They will all be impressed beyond belief
that you beat the challenge where Testicles (who left in a
huff) did not. A good time will be had by all as you wrap up
the adventure.
