#### The Splendiferous Bauble
This is a medium-sized pine cone in a simple
box. However, anybody who looks at it sees the
item that their heart most desires and is
compelled to trade anything they own in order to
obtain The Splendiferous Bauble.
When you show this item to another creature,
it must make a DC 20 Intelligence Saving Throw.
On a failure, it regards The Splendiferous Bauble
as the most desired and valuable item they have
ever seen and will be willing to trade any one
item they have on their person for The
Splendiferous Bauble. The Splendiferous Bauble
cannot compel a creature to give away anything
which would require signatures, ceremonies, or
intermediaries such as deeds or noble titles. It
will only trade the most valuable item on their
person for The Splendiferous Bauble. Minutes
after trading The Splendiferous Bauble, the
creature recognizes its true nature.
