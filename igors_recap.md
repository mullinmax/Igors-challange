The 1st day of the challange is already complete!


Mystic lightning(castors) has made strong progress... in the wrong direction.

Silverglades(nobel elves) have been stuck in their 3rd room still trying to find the exit

The undertakers are going rouge digging tunnels through the moutain rather than solve "pesky trickses"

%PLAYER TEAM% has worked their way well into the Labrynth, let's hope they continue their good progress.

-------------------------------------

Now for today's awards: there are two team awards and two individual awards, one each picked by me and the crowed. 

For most popular individual we have Aialon who's dashing looks seem to have won over the crowd early on.
I have decided to pick Flergle, for their quick whit when it comes to riddles.

For the people's choice team we have the undertakers, aparently the crowd thinks it's funny that they have decided to dig around my carefully constructed labrynth....hmph
I have chosen %PLAYER TEAM% as they have tried the hardest at every oportunity.

Each award winner should be receiving their prize shortly.

--------------------------------------

Now some notes for the teams:

Now that you have had ample time to warm up to the labrynth I will be enabling some of the more difficult challanges. So far there has been no risk of harm to yourself or time running out, you will find as you progress into the labrynth this will change. When you enevitably fail a challange you will find yourself in the bog of eternal stench, There will occasionally be oportunities to return to your team once you have arrived, search them out.

I wish you all the best of luck. 

whits win, wimps wither.
