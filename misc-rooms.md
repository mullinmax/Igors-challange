9.	An illusory wall of fire, ice, water, lightning.

10.	A room with a doorway 100-200 feet up. Walls are covered in tapestries. A random word has been engraved on the wall. Turns out it's the secret word for one of the tapestries, (treat as a flying carpet) but it has to be removed from the anti-magic clip holding it to the wall before it will respond.

11.	A curving downward staircase. Pressure plates on the staircase trigger an automated crossbow/weapon at the bottom, making it seem like someone's down there. Turns out it's just a statue wired to shoot bolts/bullets like that. Door through is beside the statue.

16.	A room with a ragged, bottomless-looking hole in the center. Closer inspection reveals massive toothmarks on the edge of the hole, and a deep breathing sound coming from far down in the bottom. Great to scare your characters. Add giant man-eating wyrm for a little more spice.

22.	A statue of a big buff man holding his bicep, hand halfway between open and a fist, and grinning. (Arm wrestle to get through)

29.	Two chains retracted into the walls 30ft apart. Pull the two together (feat of strength) to open the door. Find a way to connect them to keep it open. Door falls quickly.

44.	A table with two chairs and a statue of a smiling, one-armed hick that comes alive and starts pouring drinks. Outdrink the hick.

0.	A room with a hyper-aging field in it (turns 1 minute into one year). Inside the field, the room has given way to a lush forest with flowers that bloom, turn to fruit and drop all in the space of a minute. There's a door on the other side.
